Dataset Handling Note
Due to restrictions on accessing certain external network resources in China's network environment, direct online loading of the dataset may encounter connection instability or failures.
To address this, the complete dataset was first downloaded to local storage through compliant means. During program execution, the model reads the pre-downloaded dataset files directly from the local path for training and validation.
This approach ensures stable and efficient data loading while maintaining data integrity and accurate processing logic.
